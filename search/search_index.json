The mission to the moon was instantly aborted; it became a desperate race to bring the three astronauts home alive. On the ground at NASA's Mission Control, engineers faced a monumental challenge: how to solve complex, life-or-death problems for a system they couldn't see or touch?</p> <p>Their solution was to use their own \"twins.\" NASA had built multiple high-fidelity, physically identical simulators on the ground. To solve problems like conserving power or inventing a new procedure to restart the command module, they first ran every scenario on these terrestrial twins. This practice of using a mirrored physical system to guide a remote real-world asset was the conceptual ancestor of the Digital Twin. It highlighted a fundamental need: to have a safe, accurate, and accessible replica of a physical system to understand, predict, and optimize its behavior.</p> <p>Today, we don't always need to build a costly physical replica.
