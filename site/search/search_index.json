This requires deep domain expertise and significant time. The next frontier is to use Artificial Intelligence to automate, or at least accelerate, this process.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): These are a class of neural networks that are trained not just on data, but also on the underlying differential equations that govern a system. They can learn to solve complex physics problems, effectively creating a data-driven model that still respects the laws of physics, even in areas where training data is sparse.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generative Models for System Identification: Instead of a human manually deriving the equations for a complex system, a generative AI model (like a Graph Neural Network or a Transformer) could analyze time-series data from the system and propose a plausible underlying model structure (e.g., a stock-and-flow diagram or a set of ODEs). This could dramatically speed up the initial model-building process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Surrogate Modeling: High-fidelity physics simulations (like Finite Element Analysis or Computational Fluid Dynamics) are often too slow to run in a real-time loop. AI can be used to train a surrogate model (often a deep neural network) that learns the input-output mapping of the complex simulation. This surrogate can then run in milliseconds instead of hours, providing near-instantaneous physics-based predictions suitable for a real-time Digital Twin.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The future Digital Twin may not be built by a human, but grown by an AI that continuously learns and refines its own internal model of the world based on incoming data.</p>"},{"location":"part5/chapter15/#153-from-single-twins-to-a-society-of-twins-the-system-of-systems","title":"15.3 From Single Twins to a Society of Twins: The System of Systems","text":"<p>Today, most Digital Twins are created for a single asset or process.
