# USAGE:
# 1. Save this script as 'setup_textbook.sh' in your project's root folder.
# 2. Open your terminal and run: chmod +x setup_textbook.sh
# 3. Then execute it with:      ./setup_textbook.sh
# ==============================================================================

# --- Safety Check ---
# Ensure the script is being run from a directory containing 'mkdocs.yml'
