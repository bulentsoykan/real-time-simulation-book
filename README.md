## About This Project

This project is an open-source, web-based textbook created using **MkDocs** with the **Material for MkDocs** theme. It is designed to be a living document, easily updatable, and accessible to students and professionals interested in the intersection of simulation modeling and digital twin technologies.

The course and textbook cover a range of topics, including:
*   Foundational concepts of the Digital Twin paradigm.
*   Deep dives into core simulation methodologies:
    *   Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)
    *   Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
    *   System Dynamics (SD)
    *   Physics-Based Dynamical Systems
*   Real-time data ingestion, state synchronization, and hybrid modeling.
*   Advanced topics like continuous validation, "what-if" analysis, and simulation-based optimization.
*   Deployment architectures and the future of the field.

## For Students

This is the official online home for your course textbook. Here you will find all chapter content, lab descriptions, and supplementary materials.

*   **Navigate:** Use the left-hand navigation pane to browse through the chapters.
*   **Search:** The search bar in the header is the fastest way to find specific concepts or terms.
