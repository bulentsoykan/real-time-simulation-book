This glossary provides definitions for the key terms and concepts used throughout the textbook "Real-Time Simulation Modeling for Digital Twins."

---

### A

**ABM (Agent-Based Modeling)**
:   A simulation paradigm that models a system from the bottom up as a population of autonomous, decision-making **agents**. System-level behavior is not programmed directly but **emerges** from the local interactions of these agents. Best suited for modeling complex adaptive systems.

**Acausal Modeling**
:   A modeling approach, typified by the **Modelica** language, where the modeler defines the physical equations of components without pre-defining the direction of causality (i.e., which variables are inputs and which are outputs). The simulation engine automatically solves the entire system of equations. Contrasts with **Causal Modeling**.

**Actuator**
:   A physical device that receives a command from a control system and effects a change on the real-world asset. It is the "muscle" of a Digital Twin. (e.g., a valve, a motor, a relay).

**AFAP (As-Fast-As-Possible)**
:   An execution mode for a simulation where the virtual clock advances as quickly as the computer can process events, without regard to wall-clock time. Used for predictive "what-if" analysis and optimization.

**Agent**
:   The fundamental building block of an **ABM**. An autonomous software entity with its own internal **state**, behavioral **rules**, and actions it can perform on its environment.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
:   A set of rules and protocols that allows different software components to communicate with each other. Microservices in a DT architecture communicate via APIs.

### B

**Balancing Feedback Loop**
:   In **System Dynamics**, a feedback loop that seeks stability and counteracts change. It is goal-seeking and is also known as a negative feedback loop.

**Bayesian Calibration**
:   A statistical method for updating the belief about a model's parameters using real-world data. It starts with a **prior** probability distribution for a parameter and uses data to calculate a more accurate **posterior** distribution.

### C

**Causal Loop Diagram (CLD)**
:   A qualitative diagram used in **System Dynamics** to map the feedback structures of a system. It consists of variables connected by arrows that indicate causal influence, marked with a polarity (`+` or `-`).

**Causal Modeling**
:   A modeling approach where the modeler must explicitly define the input-output relationships and the flow of calculation. Block-diagram tools like Simulink are primarily causal. Contrasts with **Acausal Modeling**.

**Co-Simulation**
:   An approach to hybrid simulation where multiple, independent simulation models, often running in different software tools, are executed in parallel. A master algorithm coordinates the exchange of data and the advancement of time between them.

**Containerization**
:   The process of packaging a software application and all its dependencies into a single, isolated, and portable unit called a container. **Docker** is the leading containerization technology.

### D

**Data Assimilation**
:   The process of incorporating real-world observation data into a running simulation model to correct its state and improve its accuracy. A core component of continuous validation.

**DES (Discrete-Event Simulation)**
:   A simulation paradigm that models a system's operation as a chronological sequence of discrete events. The simulation clock jumps from one event to the next. Best suited for modeling processes, workflows, and resource-constrained systems.

**Digital Shadow**
:   A system where there is an automated, one-way flow of data from a physical asset to a digital model. The model can show the current state of the asset, but the link is not bidirectional.

**Digital Twin**
:   A living, simulation-powered model of a physical asset or system that is continuously synchronized with its real-world counterpart via an automated, **two-way** data link. It is used for real-time monitoring, prediction, and optimization.

**Docker**
:   The leading software platform for **containerization**.

### E

**Edge Computing**
:   A distributed computing paradigm where computation is performed on-site, on or near the physical asset, rather than in a centralized cloud. Used to reduce latency and improve reliability.

**Emergence**
:   The arising of novel, coherent structures and patterns at a macro-level from the simple, local interactions of agents at a micro-level. It is a hallmark of complex adaptive systems and is captured by **ABM**.

**Entity**
:   The fundamental dynamic object that flows through a **DES** model. (e.g., a customer, a part, a message).

**Event Calendar**
:   The core data structure in a **DES** engine. It is a time-ordered list of all future events that are scheduled to occur.

### F

**Fidelity**
:   The degree to which a simulation model accurately represents its real-world counterpart. Fidelity is a multi-dimensional concept (physical, visual, process, etc.).

**FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface)**
:   A free, industry-wide standard that defines a common API for packaging simulation models into a **Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU)**. FMUs can be easily shared and used in different co-simulation environments.

### H

**Hard Real-Time**
:   A system constraint where missing a computational deadline constitutes a total system failure. Common in safety-critical control systems.

**Hybrid Simulation**
:   The use of multiple simulation paradigms (e.g., ABM and DES) within a single, composite model to capture behaviors at different scales or from different domains.

### J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
:   A lightweight, human-readable data-interchange format. It is the de facto standard for structuring the payload of messages in IoT systems.

### K

**Kalman Filter**
:   A powerful algorithm used for **state estimation**. It produces an optimal estimate of a system's true state by recursively fusing predictions from a model with noisy measurements from sensors.

**Kubernetes**
:   The leading open-source platform for **orchestrating** containerized applications. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.

### M

**Microservices**
:   An architectural style where a complex application is composed of small, independent services, each responsible for a specific capability. They communicate over APIs and can be deployed and scaled independently.

**Modelica**
:   A non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation-based language for **acausal** modeling of complex physical systems.

**MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**
:   A lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that is the de facto standard for IoT messaging.

### O

**ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation)**
:   A mathematical equation that describes the rate of change of a system's state variables. It is the foundation of physics-based modeling for dynamical systems.

**Orchestration**
:   The automated management, coordination, and scaling of containerized applications. **Kubernetes** is the leading orchestration tool.

### P

**Prescriptive Analytics**
:   The most advanced form of analytics, which goes beyond predicting the future to recommend the best course of action to achieve a goal. Simulation-based optimization and RL are prescriptive techniques.

**Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)**
:   A messaging pattern where senders (**publishers**) do not send messages directly to receivers (**subscribers**). Instead, they publish messages to a central **broker**, which then delivers them to all interested subscribers. **MQTT** is a pub/sub protocol.

### R

**Reinforcing Feedback Loop**
:   In **System Dynamics**, a feedback loop that amplifies change, leading to exponential growth or collapse. Also known as a positive feedback loop.

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
:   A branch of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make optimal decisions by taking actions in an **environment** and receiving **rewards**. A Digital Twin can act as a high-speed, risk-free training environment for an RL agent.

**Resource**
:   A static, capacity-constrained object in a **DES** model that provides a service to entities. (e.g., a machine, an operator, a server).

### S

**SD (System Dynamics)**
:   A simulation paradigm that models the long-term behavior of complex systems from a top-down, aggregate perspective, focusing on stocks, flows, and feedback loops.

**Sensor**
:   A physical device that detects and measures a physical property of an asset and converts it into a data signal. It is the "sense organ" of a Digital Twin.

**Soft Real-Time**
:   A system constraint where missing a deadline degrades performance but does not cause a system failure. This is the most common constraint for Digital Twins.

**State Vector**
:   The set of all variables required to completely describe the state of a simulation model at a single point in time.

**Stigmergy**
:   A form of indirect communication where an agent modifies its environment, and other agents respond to that environmental change at a later time.

**Stock**
:   The fundamental building block of an **SD** model representing an accumulation of something. A stock can only be changed by its in-flows and out-flows.

**Stochastic**
:   A process or model that incorporates randomness. Contrasts with **Deterministic**.

### T

**Time-Series Database**
:   A database specifically designed to store and query large volumes of timestamped data, such as sensor readings from a Digital Twin.

**Topic (MQTT)**
:   A hierarchical string used in MQTT to label and route messages. Publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers receive messages by subscribing to a topic.

### U

**Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)**
:   The process of identifying, characterizing, and quantifying the uncertainty in a simulation model's inputs, parameters, and structure, and then propagating that uncertainty to its outputs.

### V

**Validation**
:   The process of determining if a simulation model is an accurate representation of the real-world system for its intended purpose. *"Are we building the right model?"*

**Verification**
:   The process of determining if a simulation model is implemented correctly and matches its conceptual design. *"Are we building the model right?"*
